## Deployment of React Application (Frontend)

### Step 1: Complete and Test React Application

Ensure that the React web application is complete and tested. Verify all the functionalities that a user can be performing in the application.

### Step 2: Build the Application

Run `npm run build` to generate either a `build` or `dist` folder containing the production-ready files. The folder name depends on the project configuration (e.g., a normal React app generates a `build` folder, while Vite generates `dist` ).

### Step 3: Upload files into a  GitHub Repository

- Create a new GitHub repository and upload the files into the repository.
- If you are already working in a github repo, just commit and push the files.

### Step 4: Deploy on Vercel

- Visit [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), you can be able to continue sign-up using github account. Otherwise you can sign-up with email and then later on connect with github.
- Import the project from the github repo.
- If you are not able to find the github repo, there would be an option like `Missing Git repository? Adjust GitHub App Permissions â†’` you can just add the required github repo to vercel.
- Follow the prompts to deploy the React application.
